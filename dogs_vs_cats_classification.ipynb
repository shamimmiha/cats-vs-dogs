    "\n",
    "3. **Our Custom Top**: We add our own layers on top of VGG16:\n",
    "   - **Flatten()**: Converts the 3D output of VGG16 into a 1D vector\n",
    "   - **Dense(256)**: A fully connected layer with 256 neurons\n",
    "   - **Dropout(0.5)**: Randomly turns off 50% of neurons during training to prevent overfitting\n",
    "   - **Dense(1, sigmoid)**: Our output layer - one neuron with sigmoid activation that gives us a probability (0-1) of the image being a dog\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compilation**: We set up our training process with:\n",
    "   - **binary_crossentropy**: The loss function suited for binary (two-class) problems\n",
    "   - **Adam optimizer**: An adaptive learning algorithm that helps find the optimal weights\n",
    "   - **learning_rate=0.0001**: A small learning rate to make small, careful updates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Harry**: I think I get it! We're using VGG16 as our foundation, and just adding our own \"dog vs. cat\" detector on top. But what's this \"overfitting\" you mentioned?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adil**: Great question! Overfitting is like memorizing the answers to a test instead of understanding the material. The model learns the training data too well, including all its noise and peculiarities, but then performs poorly on new, unseen examples. Dropout helps prevent this by forcing the network to be more robust."
